Demonstration of React Drag and Drop Functionality
This project demonstrates how to implement drag and drop functionality using React. The drag and drop feature allows users to interactively move elements around the screen by clicking and dragging.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project directory:
cd assesment

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.

Drag and Drop Implementation
In this project, we have implemented drag and drop functionality using React's built-in support for HTML5 drag and drop events.

Draggable Component: We have a Draggable component that represents the element that can be dragged. This component uses the draggable attribute to make it draggable and handles the necessary drag events.

Droppable Component: We also have a Droppable component that represents the area where the draggable element can be dropped. This component handles the necessary drop events to perform actions when a draggable element is dropped onto it.

Event Handlers: The Draggable component defines event handlers for the dragstart and dragend events. These handlers are responsible for storing the data associated with the dragged element and updating the component state accordingly.

State Management: The state management in this project is handled using React's useState hook. When a draggable element is dropped onto the drop zone, the component state is updated to reflect the changes, and the UI is re-rendered accordingly.

Working of Drag and Drop
Start dragging: To initiate a drag operation, click and hold on a draggable element. The element will visually indicate that it is being dragged.

Dragging: While dragging, you can move the element around the screen by moving your mouse pointer. The element follows the movement of the mouse cursor.

Dropping: To drop a draggable element onto a droppable area, release the mouse button. The element will be placed at the drop location, and the necessary actions will be performed based on the drop event handlers.

Updating UI: When a draggable element is dropped onto a droppable area, the component state is updated, triggering a re-render of the UI. You will see the changes reflected in the application interface.

That's it! You now have a basic understanding of how to implement drag and drop functionality using React. Feel free to explore the code in this project and customize it to suit your specific requirements.
